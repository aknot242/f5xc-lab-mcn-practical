# **Overview**

This lab is a "practical" training activity.
Each exercise will ask you to **configure** F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) objects to reinforce a core XC Multi-Cloud networking concept. 
Once configured, you'll be asked to **test** your configuration from this web application.

# **Getting Started**

When your UDF deployment launched, two automated processes started.

### User Creation

Tenant onboarding has started for your user.

Check the email used to launch your UDF deployment for a "welcome" or password reset email to the [F5-XC-MCN-Lab](https://f5-xc-lab-mcn.console.ves.volterra.io/) tenant.

### CE Registration

The Customer Edge in your UDF deployment is being registered with the [F5-XC-MCN-Lab](https://f5-xc-lab-mcn.console.ves.volterra.io/) tenant.
CEs on first launch update software and, often, thier OS. This can be very time consuming. 

# **Setup**

Before starting you must configure base domain used in exercises from the [setup](/setup) page.
